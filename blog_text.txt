If you are looking for a job in linguistics/computational linguistics, then one obvious question is: At what time of the year will there be jobs? Is there a particularly good/bad time? Or is there a constant stream of job openings?

To answer this question, I wrote a script that crunched through newsletters from LinguistList [LL; link], which, among other things, contains job ads for linguists/computational linguists. The script went through all LL newsletters from 2015 t.e.m.* 2017, which is 864 emails. For each job opening, the script categorised whether it's an opening for 1) a PostDoc, 2) a professorship or similar, 3) some other academic position, or 4) an industry job. The script also counted how many jobs fell into which category for each month. 

I've then plotted the results using R; below is the plot.

[plot1]

The graph tells us three things in particular: 1) Professorships and alike is the most frequent kind of job offering on LL, pushing everything else to the lower third of the scale. 2) If you want to become a prof, then Sep and Oct are a particularly good time to look for jobs. 3) That said, there's always some kind of a stream of jobs, for all four categories. 

Because of 1), I've plotted the same things without professorships. This is the plot below.

The second plot reveals a few more things; let's focus on three points in particular. 1) The top three months for PostDocs are Jan, Feb, Apr, with Jul being a close runners up. Bar Jul, Q3 and Q4 is not the best time for PostDoc applications. 2) There's a constant stream of industry jobs. However, there's a big slump in Apr and a bit of a slump in Dec. An obvious hypothesis wrt Dec is that companies wait until after the Christmas break before putting ads out. I am not sure about Apr, tho. 3) The "other academic jobs" category peaks in Jul to Oct.
