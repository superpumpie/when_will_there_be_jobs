The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Indiana University and as such can receive 
donations through the eLinguistics Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 45-4211155. These donations can be offset
against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only).
For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the eLinguistics Foundation 
fills in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative 
procedure that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you 
an extra penny. Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
