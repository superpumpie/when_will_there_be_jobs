Dear readers,

Today, you may notice that your email inbox will be a little emptier
than usual. We will not be posting the usual dozens of issues to
LINGUIST or the daily summary to LINGLITE today in order to raise
awareness for our continuing Fund Drive 2017.

Did you know that we are projected to post over 6000 issues in this year
alone? With only 5 editors, this is the highest ratio of issues to
editors that the LINGUIST List has ever had! We believe in the work that
we do, and we have never–and will never–charge our readers! At the same
time, we hope that our readers will choose to support us as they are able.

Last year, we received 783 generous donations from our readers. At this
point in our Fund Drive, we have nearly reached that number–and we
believe we can even surpass it! After all, this is only a little over 2%
of our readership... ;-)

To those of you who have already supported us, we offer our sincerest
thanks! And we hope that if you haven't yet, you will visit our Fund
Drive homepage (http://funddrive.linguistlist.org/) to read more about
this campaign and why we need YOUR help.

Gratefully yours,

The LINGUIST List team
